# rfrontier
## Stata package for robust stochastic frontier analysis
This facilitates estimation of stochastic frontier models with alternative distributional assumptions, including models with in which the noise terms follows a Student's t, Cauchy, or logistic distribution. The package can then be used to generate efficiency predictions, influence functions (for parameter estimates and for efficiency predictions) and related postestimation outputs. The main purposes of this package are to enable easy implementation of some of the stochastic frontier specifications explored in publications I have co-authored, and to ease replication of some of the results reported in these publications.

## Installation
In order to install the command, enter the following commands into Stata (the first is unnecessary if you already have the `github` command installed):
```stata
net install github, from("https://haghish.github.io/github/")
github install AlexStead/rfrontier
```

## Getting started
For help with the command's syntax and options, enter (after installation):
```stata
help rfrontier
help rfrontier_postestimation
```
